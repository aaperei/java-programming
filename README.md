# Welcome to Java Programming Project!

This project was implemented in order to demonstrate how to solve some basic problems using Java Programming Language.

# Requirements
 - JDK 11


# Algorithms implemented
 - Computing the results of an election -> `com.alison.logic.election.Election`
 - Sorting using Bubble Sort  -> `com.alison.logic.sorting.Sorting`
 - Factorial of a given number  -> `com.alison.logic.math.Math`
 - Sum of multiples of 3 or 5  -> `com.alison.logic.math.Math`

# Run the application
Each class listed above has its own main method. Just compile and run the class you want see the results. Feel free to add new scenarios to the main method.
